# GeoJSON Diff

*A Ruby library for diffing GeoJSON files*

## Overview

GeoJSON Diff takes two GeoJSON files representing the same geometry (or geometries) at two points in time, and generates three GeoJSON files represented the added, removed, and unchanged geometries. These three geojson files can be used to generate a visual representation of the changes (proposed or realized), e.g., by coloring the added elements green and the removed elements red. See [diffable, more customizable maps](https://github.com/blog/1772-diffable-more-customizable-maps) for more information.

## Usage

```ruby
diff = GeojsonDiff.new geojson_before, geojson_after

diff.added
# => {"type":"Feature"... (valid GeoJSON representing the added geometries)

diff.removed
# => {"type":"Feature"... (valid GeoJSON representing the removed geometries)

diff.unchanged
# => {"type":"Feature"... (valid GeoJSON representing the unchanged geometries)
```

For practical examples, take a look at the [test/fixtures directory](test/fixtures).

## Displaying the resulting GeoJSON

Every geometry within the resulting GeoJSON files will be appended with standard GeoJSON properties in the `_geojson_diff` namespace.

* `type` - this field contains either `added`, `removed`, or `unchanged` and describes the state of the geometry as it relates to the initial GeoJSON file.
* `added`, `removed`, `changed` - these fields contain an array of property keys. If a given key is in the `added` array, that property existed in the resulting geometry, but not in the initial geometry. Likewise, if a key is in `removed` array it existed in the initial geometry, but not the resulting geometry, and if the key is in the `changed` array, it existed in both the initial and resulting geometry, but was changed.
* For changed properties, the values of the `after` GeoJSON file will be marked up as a [diffy `:html` diff](https://github.com/samg/diffy#html-output) and will represent the inline diff of the changed value.

## Installation

### Requirements

GeoJSON Diff is bassed on [rgeo](https://github.com/dazuma/rgeo), [rgeo-geojson](https://github.com/dazuma/rgeo-geojson), [geos](http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/), [ffi-geos](https://github.com/dark-panda/ffi-geos), and [diffy](https://github.com/samg/diffy).

### Installing GEOS

If you're on OS X and have Homebrew installed, you'll first want to run `brew install geos` to install the GEOS geospatial library. On other systems, consult [the GEOS installation instructions](http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/).

### Installing the Gem

Add the following to your project's Gemfile and run `bundle install`:

`gem 'geojson-diff'`

### Pro-Tip

Because the library depends on [GEOS](http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/), which can be finicky on some systems, the set-it-and-forget-it way to get everything set up is to copy-and-paste and run the commands in [script/bootstrap](script/bootstrap), which will install GEOS and configure the necessary environmental values.

## Development

### Bootstrapping a local development environment

`script/bootstrap`

### Running tests

`script/cibuild`

### Development console

`script/console`

## Troubleshooting GEOS

On some environments, prior to running your application or running `bundle install`, you'll need to run the following commands to properly configure your execution environment for Ruby to find the GEOS library:

```
export GEOS_LIBRARY_PATH=`geos-config --prefix`/lib
bundle config --local build.rgeo --with-geos-dir="$GEOS_LIBRARY_PATH"
````
